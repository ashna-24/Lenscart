                      <p>Ans. Quality is at the core of Lenskart’s products. Our plastic frames are made from the best quality acetate and our metal frames are made only from steel or titanium – this makes our glasses corrosion and breakage resistant.

                      <h3>Ques 10. What lenses will you use? I use thin, anti-glare lenses.</h3>
                      <p>Ans. We understand that a pair of glasses is only as good as the lenses fitted in them. Most anti-glare lenses cost between Rs.1,500 - 2,000 at your local optician. At that price we give you robotically fitted, anti-glare lenses, with a 1.6 index which is ~35% thinner than market average. In addition we offer UV-400 protection on all our lenses, similar to what is provided in contact lenses across Europe and the USA</p>
